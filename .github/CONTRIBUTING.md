Let's talk it out.

- If your issue is small or obvious (ie. spelling / correctness with working consistency) explain in the PR.
- If it's about how you'd do it better, it better not start as a PR.
- If you want to help, be helpful not condescending.

I'm on [discord](https://discord.gg/22YcETVb) if you wanna chat.
